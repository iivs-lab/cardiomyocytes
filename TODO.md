# TODO

Tracked items that are not yet captured in code or tests. Promote an
item to a CHANGELOG entry once it lands.

## Open

- **Rework the optical-flow benchmark on real data.** Replace the seeded
  synthetic scene in `scripts/optical_flow/benchmark_opencv.py` with real
  cardiomyocyte imaging data and the optical-flow parameters used in prior
  experiments. The current synthetic benchmark reports Dual TV-L1 quality
  *below* Farneback — the opposite of what is expected — so its numbers
  (TV-L1's especially) are provisional and should not be trusted until the
  rework lands.
